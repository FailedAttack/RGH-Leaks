In accordance with Xbox's Terms of Service, we are actively collaborating with Microsoft to address the issue of unauthorized RGH users and stealth servers. Our ongoing efforts aim to maintain a secure and fair gaming environment for all users.

Despite attempts by certain individuals to disrupt our operations through DDoS attacks, system resets, freezing, or crashing, our team remains resilient. We have implemented advanced anti-RME tools developed by our security specialists, effectively neutralizing unauthorized modifications and ensuring the integrity of our platform.

We remain committed to upholding a professional and secure community. Thank you for your continued support.

Have a great day,
