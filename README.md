Since returning to the U.S. from Japan, it’s clear that some still don’t grasp the concept of "playing nice." Initially, I aimed to maintain good relations with everyone, but over the years, xbOnline has been the only stealth server with which I’ve had a consistently positive relationship. Even after they transitioned to a private model, we remain on good terms. I’m still working to verify through my sources if they have any connection to Guard or Shield.

At this point, however, nearly everyone else has become a source of frustration. It seems Ninja has resurfaced, likely utilizing the same leaked code from years ago. It would be unfortunate if the servers they rely on were compromised again, leaving them to falsely claim service terminations due to non-payment—when in reality, they’ve long had the financial means and effectively monopolized the RGH modding scene.

It’s hard to say which is more troubling nowadays: the increasing trend of people identifying as whatever they choose or the state of the modern modding community. We’re seeing more and more individuals proudly spending $150 on code that’s simply ripped and reused.

When that code inevitably becomes public, many of you will realize you overpaid. Unfortunately, collaboration and fair play have become rare in this space.

For a while, my team has been handling the bulk of the workload, but the time for niceties is over. It’s disappointing to witness people selling stolen code and others who claim to understand networking, when they clearly don’t. I’ve heard things like, “He’s sending UDP to a TCP server,” when packets would be dropped either way, regardless of protocol. Or, “He’s crashing the server’s CPU,” when the actual issue is your inadequate OVH or Royale Hosting services.

I’ve extended offers to help many of you establish proper protections and filtering, yet you still complain when my team and I manage to take down your failover servers—despite your so-called “always-on” mitigation. It’s almost comical. I couldn’t help but laugh when some of you believed I had access to RME files, when in reality, your off-host HvH capabilities couldn’t even compete with my free off-host.

The real turning point came when I realized that, despite enduring weekly attacks exceeding 1 Tb on my budget server, you all still fail in your attempts to take me offline. And let’s not forget—it wasn’t a coincidence that Black Ops II was down for a week. I understand many of you cling to that old CoD title because you can’t afford a proper gaming PC or a next-gen console.
